# Customer Churn Analysis

Data science project that predicts customers who are likely to churn using Telco data.


## Code and Packages

**Python version:** 3.9.13

**Packages:** Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## EDA

In this step I did data exploration to better understand the dataset.


## Examined Models 

The models used for this project are:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

To evaluate the model results I used **precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score and ROC_AUC curve.**

## Feature Selection 

Since I had 44 features to train the models I performed a feature selection algorithm. The methods I compared in order to pick the most suitable one were the following:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Recursive feature elimination
